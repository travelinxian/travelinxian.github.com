You may hear of Chang An before your coming to Xi'an. Chang An is the old name
of Xi'an in history, as we all know, it's one of the four civilized ancient countries
in the world. And as a ancient city in China, there're 13 empires in China's history to
make Chang An as the capital.

Now, with the new China(PRC) has established since 1949, Xi'an is the new name of the city,
while Chang An one of the disticts in Xi'an, which locates in South of Xi'an. And today I want
to focus on the Chang An District and want to share some interesting stuffs about this place.

Comparing to other disticts in Xi'an, Chang An is in the outskirt and it's very near to the 
QingLing Mountain, and it's the biggest district in Xi'an, and also maybe the least developing
area in Xi'an. But that means you can find something very interesting as the real rural life
of this ancient place.

Heading to south from Bell Tower in Xi'an, after around 40 minutes, you'll arrive to the heart of
Chang An District, i.e Wei Qu. Don't stop here, you need to go to the Guo Du via the Wei Guo Road
from east to west. Then following the Xi Feng Road, you can continue to drive to the south, until
the mountain becomes more and more clear. 

Then the mountian is in front of your eyes, which every detail is easy to catch. From here, you can 
foget the city and immerse yourself in the great beauty of nature, with mountains, rivers, and forests.

You can choose to climb the mountain or forest park, or the rural families for the good meals.

Let's talk them one by one.

## Climb Mountain

There're over 10 channels in Qin Ling Mountain, and Feng Yu Channel, Xiang Yu Channel are the 2 most famous ones.
Pick one of the 2, and follow the roads, you can get the top easily since it's not that high. 

In the process, you can see some great mountain rocks, some rivers which are from the waters melted from mountain
snows, forests with green trees, and birds' flying and singing.

After arriving at the top, if you're lucky enough, you can see the inner city of Xi'an from the top. But I guess
you will get disappointed mostly for the polution reasons. Anyway, it's good to have some free time to enjoy the
fresh air and quiet birds' singing.

## Forest Park

The Xiang Yu National Forest Park is a good place to see the original plans in Qin Ling Mountain and it also has 
a waterfall called Gao Guan Waterfall, which is a narrow stream of water dropping from the top to the bottom, so
it's very terrific to watch from a long distance. The water dropping quickly, the sound from the water dropping, 
the green plans around, the spoondrift when the water drops hit the surface of the lake in the bottom.

There're lots of pine trees in the mountain. No matter near or far, you can see the green filled in your eyes. 
Maybe you will meet some small animals like squirrels, and birds like eagles, etc.

## Rural hotel and meals

There're a lot of rural hotel and families to welcome visitors everyday, and they provide complete services after
several years developing, including fishing(then you can barbecue what you have fished), barbecue, Ma Jiang, etc.

Every weekend, the people from Xi'an downtown will come here to find some interesting places and enjoy the weekend
with family or friends. 

Meal is the biggest topic in Chinese daily life. When we get used to the beaf, chicken, pork, it's good to find other
meals to eat, mostly vegetables, which are called "Nong Jia Le"(joy in rural family in English). 

There're a lot of good rural meals in Chang An, which are healthy and green, so go there just enjoy the day with fresh
air, quiet birds' singing, with the mountain nearby...
