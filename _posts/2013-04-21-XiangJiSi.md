"XiangJi Si" may be the name I love most for a temple, which was built 
in China's Tang Dynasty and has over 1000 years' history. "XiangJi" means
collection of fragrance, and "Si" means temple, a Buddhism temple.

Two years ago, when I came back from Beijing with my wife, I began a startup
with 2 friends, and things didn't go through so well, and I felt not that good
at that time. One day, a rainy day, in June, the day's not cold, but you can feel
the fresh air with the rain, so I decided to go out for a small trip for relaxing.
XiangJi Si became my destination. By taking a bus, I arrived at the temple in the 
morning. For the rain, there were only several persons in the temple and most of them
are the monks, only 2-3 visitors including me.

The temple locates in a small village called "XiangJi Village", which is named by the
template I guess. By following the road with muds and rains, the gate stopped me finally.
The gate is a big one, with some sculptures of animals, like elephants, dragons, etc.
From the gate, a tower is not far in the temple, so I went directly into the temple and
start the finding.

It's amazing that I found another vistor who was looking at the poems in the stele. Acutally
there're 30-50 steles there with poems in the surfaces. Most of the poems are related with
the temple, including some famous ones like WangWei's "bypassing XiangJi Si".

Continuing my walk, I was more and more closer to the towerï¼Œwhich was built in Tang Dynasty
as saying. The tower is a great building, and some of the surfaces are broken for the 
long time's impact of raining and blowing. Even though, when you stand under the tower, you'll
feel the greatness of the building and be impressed by the masterpiece of the ancient people.

When I walked out of the temple, and looked at the quiet, great place again, I felt a little differnt.
This temple was a great place in that time, but with the time passing, it's no longer that famous,
but it cannot stop its greatness. We can imgine how difficult it is for the ancient guys to build
such a great place, which needs so much patience and knowledge, but they did, and did it really well.

When I got the bus back to my apartment, I believe in one faith: patience and knowledge can lead to
greatness. 

And then I continue my work with a better mood.
