Sports is based on economics, and Xi'an is never a city in the top list(ranked ~30 in
the 1st quarter 2013 in China ordered by GDP), so sports in Xi'an is not that charming. Acutally
that's almost correct. In Xi'an you won't find a football or basketball team in China's top
leagure and you can't find some sports popstars who are from Xi'an. So looking for the sports
things in Xi'an may lead you to the mood of disappointment. But for me, enough is the best.
I choose the sport I can anticipate in and Xi'an does well in this perspective.

Acutally I meant marathon. 

3 years ago, I came back from Beijing and started my new life here. With a not successful startup
experience, I joined a big telecommunication company. Though the work is with big pressure and 
took most of my spare time, I can still make time for my hobby, e.g long distance running.

2012, I joined the 1st Lining 10K marathon in Qujiang. And yesterday, I did that again for the 2nd
time. Someone may think marathon is boring for its only action - running and running, but I guess that
is the best part for me, since I take marathon as a check, check for my patience, check for my perseverance.
For, the one who can't stand on the loneness is the one who can't stand out in the area. So my goal is always
not that big, - keeping running and never stops and walk, and try best to make a good score - that's all.
1h25s for 2012 and 1h3m48s for 2013. Seems the score is a little lower than last year, but I feel better.

1 month ago, I also anticipated a 14K marathon which was held in Xi'an ancient guard wall, which is also a 
landmark in Xi'an. It took me 86m to finish. With a not hot whether, a comfortable wind on the face, running
is always a joy. The visitors to the wall always smile to you and say good words to encourge you. That's good
to enjoy the whole process.

When the finish line is not that far before me, I told myself that's the time to speed up and pass the line. So I did
it, and cross the line as quickly as I could. With sweats all over the body, looking back to the roads I ran, 
an unmatchable feeling hits me like a lighning and a big smile always shines on my face.

So if you want to enjoy the marathon in Xi'an, it's not that bad in my experience till now. And as appointed
with my close friends, we will anticipate the activity every year, until one day I can't run at all.

Quoted one answer from Quora for the question "Why do you like marathon?"

"There will be a day when you can no longer do this, but today is NOT the day."
