I was born in Xi\'an and live here for all the time except 4 years 
college life in Beijing for my master degree.

I love traveling to different places, domestic or abroad. Each time,
when I get to a new place, I want to get the latest information for this place,
the interesting places, the interesting persons, etc. But seems it\'s hard 
to grab some good sources for this kind of information.

This blog wants to be one of the reliable source for you when traveling in Xi\'an.
I want to make it reliable by:

1. My first-hand information with my feet on. What I saw is what I will write.
2. Photos taken by me to prove or show something interesting or bad.

So all information should be verified by me at least, which can be trusted.

No ads will be included in the posts, and if it does, the ads will be marked out
to make it easy to tell.

Finally, my updating schedule for this blog is one post a week. Feel free to leave 
your comments under the post, and I will try to answer it as much as I can.

Hope you will enjoy the traveling in Xi\'an and we Xi\'aner welcome you!
